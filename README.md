# Oppidum

PC-less DevOps setup, main goal is to migrate completely from local terminal to remote.

You can try it yourself just click on button below and you will get my whole dev experience.

## Why?

There are three main reasons:

1. **Docker Desktop**

   Running Docker on Mac OS or Windows is pain, not to mention new [licencing](https://www.docker.com/pricing/faq) policy. With remote development this is not the case as we use native docker on linux.

2. **Environment setup**

   With defined remote environment we are guaranteed that migrating to new machine will not lead to lost setup.

3. **Work everywhere**

   With remote environment we can use slower devices like tablets without caring on platform performance and architecture.

## How?

Currently I have choosen [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/) as best balance of UX, OSS and cost. 

This repo is my OSS environment with all configuration and tools I need. For specific clients I will use their respective private repositories forked from this repo.
